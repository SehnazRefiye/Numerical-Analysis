Q1.py = Approximate sin(2x) with using the first five terms of the Taylor series expansion for x=π/4. Explain what type of error we are dealing with for this problem. Calculate absolute error, relative error and percentage error.

Q2.py = Use Gauss elimination to solve the equations Ax=B where A = [[2, -3, -1], [3, 2, -5], [2, 4, -1]] B = [3, -9, -5]

Q3 = Solve the equations Ax=B by Doolittle’s decomposition method where A = [[2.33, -4.10, 1.78], [-1.98, 3.47, -2.22], [2.36, -15.17, 6.18]] B = [0.02, -0.73, -6.63]

Question1.py = Find a polynomial P(x) of degree 3 or less whose graph passes through the four data points (−2,8), (0,4), (1,2), (3,−2). Use Newton’s divided difference interpolation method.

Question2.py = Use Newton-Raphson Method to find the root to four correct decimal places for 3x^3 + x^2 = x + 5 where x0 = -1.

Question3.py = Use finite difference approximations of O(h2) among forward difference (FD), backward difference (BD) and central difference (CD) to compute f'(2.38) and f''(2.38) from the following data: (2.36, 0.85866), (2.27, 0.86289), (2.38, 0.86710), (2.39, 0.87129)

Question4.py = Evaluate integration x^2 with Simpson’s 1/3 rule using two, four, and six panels x1=0, x2=1.
